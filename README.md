## Course Reflection

This web development course gave me a strong introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”essential tools for building interactive websites. Through hands-on projects like a portfolio site, a Tic Tac Toe game, a calculator, and a dynamic pizza menu, I gained valuable experience that bridged theory with practice.

The course emphasized real-world skills such as problem-solving, debugging, and designing functional interfaces. Understanding how HTML structures content, CSS handles styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity gave me the foundation needed for future growth in tech.

JavaScript stood out as a key language, enabling dynamic web experiences and preparing me for advanced frameworks like React and Vue.js. Its flexibility is crucial in both front-end and full-stack roles.
